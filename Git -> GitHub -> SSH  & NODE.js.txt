Git -> GitHub -> SSH  & NODE.js
Connecting git bash with gitHub :
Enter git bash then press the following thing :
1.	git config –global user.name”your github name”
2.	git config –global user.email”email used in that github”
3.	verify configuration by this line :  git config --global –list
Generating SSH Key :
1.	generate SSH key by : ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “your.email@example.com(your github email )”
2.	To start SSH agent to manage SSH key press : eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
3.	Add SSH private key to SSH agent : ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
4.	Copy SSH key to clipboard by writing this line (it will copy automatically .. On Windows applicable only) : clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   
Adding SSH Key to GitHub :
1.	GitHub>settings>SSH and GPG keys>click new SSH Key ..
Paste the SSh key into the key field and add title of your own.
2.	To test the connection press : ssh -T git@github.com
Upto this part we done the SSH work . no need to do this again and again . 
Lets do code in VS Code and connect it with GitHUb using SSH Key :
•	Create a repository in github and copy the path created .
•	Go to gitbash and write – git clone link_you_copied
•	Then write – ls (to see folder name present in that..means branch of it … )
•	Then write – cd repository_name (to enter into the folder)

This part is to create the main folder . (for example we mape a cpp folder and then put all code in that folder together…this is similar kind of that ..)
Now we will push code in the following way : 
Open folder of your repository from the file option then Create new file in Vscode
Suppose we named : README.md 
Then we can write something in README.md file in VScode then check it…
•	Go to gitbash again and check it by :  git status 
( if untracked message is shown then we have to solve it )
•	To solve it : git add README.md
•	Again check by : git status ( now it will became tracked)
•	Type : git commit –m”type anything by which you want to commit so that later anyone can see that and understand”
•	Type : git log  
(by this you can see the commit including the author name and the timing )
•	Now each time we do anything we have to push it to GitHub to store there .. to do so type : git push origin main 

ALL SET NOW  >>>>>>  DONE

Easy way to push file in the folder :
Suppose you want to add a smrity.txt file or git_practise.cpp file (any type of file ). In that case you will do your work as usual and then drag that file and put it to that folder (try to keep that folder in desktop it will become easy for you)
Then do the following step :
•	Gitbash : cd (then drag the main folder here in which you want to push file )
•	Gitbash : ls (it will show you the file present inside that folder )
•	Gitbash : git status (here you may see that the file you drag in that folder that file name will appear red color for example : smrity.txt )
•	Gitbash : git add . (add . means add all unadded file ..if you give specific file name then it will add only that one )
•	Gitbash : git status  ( now all will appear green which means ok )
•	Gitbash : git commit –m”write any meaningful status here ..like added new file..any imp line”
•	Gitbash : git log ( it will show all the commited line along with date and author name )
•	q(to come out of log you have to press q )
•	Gitbash : git push (this is the important line ..it is used to push it into your github )
•	After doing modification you can commit once . can’t commit multiple times after single modification . after each modification you will get 1 chance each time to commit .

****************************************************************************************
terminal => cd desktop -> to come to desktop
cd .. -> to go back 
ls -> to see file in that particular folder

how to push file in github and push files there :
1)open terminal in desktop then : git clone link_of_the_repository_you_created_in_github
2)ls -> to see if files are present or not 
3)git add . -> to add files
4)git commit -m"destription"
5)git push

Install Node.js = install LTS type :
•	Install Node.js …..just type next ..to check it type the following:
•	Gitbash or git CMD : node –v (it will show you the version)
•	Gitbash or git CMD : npm –v ( package installed or not )
